###Enabling Full Screen Mode (for VM only)###
Open terminal

If you don't have the Kali sources.list repositories follow This:
    Open the browser, go to docs.kali.org
    Search for sources.list repositories and click.
    Copy the regular depositories source link and add to /etc/apt/sources.list

    On the terminal:
    $ cd /etc/apt
    $ nano sources.list

    Check if you don't have the link inside the file already.
    Save and close the file.

If you have the Kali sources.list repositories:
    On the terminal:
    $ apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r) 
        ###IT WILL FAIL###
    $ uname -r 
        ###checks linux headers current version###
        output will be something as "4.18.0-kali2-amd64"
    $ apt install linux-headers-$-* 
        ###will show every version available for headers###
        will ask if you want to install all of those. CHOOSE NO!
        Seek for the last version of linux headers, copy it.
    $ apt install linux-image-$-[copy the last version]

    $ reboot
    
    $ uname -r
        ###So you can check if the newest version has been installed###
    $ apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
        ###Choose YES and wait###
    
Go to your VM tab menus.
    Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image
    It will ask if you want to start it automatically. Choose "CANCEL" option.

Terminal:
    $ cd /media/cdrom
    $ ls 
    
    Check if VboxLinuxAdditions is a .run file.
    If not:
        $ chmod +x VboxLinuxAdditions.run
    
    $ sh ./VboxLinuxAdditions.run

Wait for it. VM will probably crash, but after turning it on again, it will be fullscreen.
